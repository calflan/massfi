|| This is a university project ||

The Hut Group have assigned the task of re-designing the product page of their Mass.fi website. I have decided to take on this task, by rethinking the UX, accessibility and usability as a whole of the page.

The work in this repo is not associated with the The Hut Group ltd. in anyway and does not represent their code base.

This work is solely my own.
